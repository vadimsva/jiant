Jiant

    Javascript Interface Abstract Notation

The aim of this project is maximally reduce complexity of large ajax, highly dynamic 
javascript project development and support. 

It provides means for modern auto-complete tools. Jiant eliminates usage of strings for UI elements identification
as far as possible, replacing it by variables. It also moves linking of html elements to javascript variables 
from execution time to start time where possible.

Jiant is more of philosophy how to develop application, not particular technical implementation of set of tricks.
